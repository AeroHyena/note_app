Here is how to serve files in codespace so that you can view your webapp in browser:

- run the following commmand in terminal to install a tool that easily creates a server:
```npm i -g http-server```

- Then, every time you want to view your webapp, run the http-server command in the terminal. you will then have a link under "ports"
that you can use to view your files.

if struggling with server files not updating, use http-server -c-1 p8080.
